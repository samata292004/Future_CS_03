## ðŸš© Task 3 â€” Secure File Sharing System

This repository contains my completed work for Task 3 of the Future Interns Cyber Security Internship.

### ðŸ“Œ What it does

- Uses Flask and AES encryption (PyCryptodome) to securely upload and share files.
- POST /upload: Uploads a file, encrypts it with AES, saves it as .enc.
- GET /download/<filename>: Decrypts the .enc file and returns the original securely.
